== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the results? =

Insert the following code into your WordPress theme files: 

=General results=
Without passing any parameters, the plugin will return ten results or fewer depending on how many posts you have.

 popularPosts();

=Specific number of results=
If you would like to return a specific number of results as your maximum:

 popularPosts('count=10');

=Altering the before and after values=<
By default the plugin wraps your code in list item (&lt;li&gt;) tags but you can specify how to format the results using the following code:

 popularPosts('before=&lt;p&gt;&amp;after=&lt;/p&gt;');


=The Order=<
You can now change the order of the results using ASC, DESC or RAND to return the results in ascending, descending or random order.

 popularPosts('order=ASC');


=Echo vs. Return=
Finally, if you'd like to copy the results into a variable you can return the results as follows:

 popularPosts('show=false'); 

=Combining Arguements=

If you'd like to call multiple arguments you can do so by separating them with a & symbol:

 popularPosts('show=false&order=ASC');
